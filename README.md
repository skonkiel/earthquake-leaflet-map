# Earthquake Map

This project uses the Leaflet.js library to map earthquake data from the past 30 days, drawn dynamically from the USGS API.

It contains two parts:
1. Step 1, which maps the earthquake data using markers that vary based upon magnitude
2. Step 2, which adds in tectonic plate data as a layer, helping the user see the relationship between plate location and earthquake activity
