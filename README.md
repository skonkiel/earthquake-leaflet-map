# Earthquake Map

This project uses the Leaflet.js library to map earthquake data from the past 30 days, drawn dynamically from the USGS API. These map showcase the location and magnitude of recent earthquakes in the US, helping users understand earthquake activity using intuitive design choices like color and size.

It contains two parts:
1. Step 1, which maps the earthquake data using markers that vary based upon magnitude
2. Step 2, which adds in tectonic plate data as a layer, helping the user see the relationship between plate location and earthquake activity

To view this map, clone this repository locally and add your [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/) API key in a `config.js` file in the top-level project directory.
